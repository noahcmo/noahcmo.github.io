Aloha! My name is Noah Okamoto and I am a junior here at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. I was born and raised on the island of Maui. I am the second-born in a family of four; I have an older brother, a younger brother, and a younger sister (the princess). 

I played baseball from ages 5 through 18 (senior year), which instilled many valuable lessons and skills in my life, such as teamwork, optimism, sportsmanship, and humility. In 2012, my all-star team won the Hawai'i championships in Junior League (the division after little league) and took second place in the Western Region. We were so close to going to the World Series!

I graduated from Maui High School in 2015 with honors, and immediately began my college education at the University of Hawai'i Maui College. I received my Associates Degree in Liberal Arts in 2017 while maintaining a GPA I am extremely proud of. I made the Dean's List multiple times and was a part of PTK, the honor society at UHMC, while working part time at the Fairmont Kea Lani and the Royal Lahaina Resort.
